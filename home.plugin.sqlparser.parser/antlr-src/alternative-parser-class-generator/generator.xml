    Generate antlr sources. This script works as an Eclipse builder.
    Required properties:
     build-fileset - space-separated, list of absolute, quoted paths to files to be built
                     if not set - all g4 files are built (full build)
     build-project-location - core project location
  </description>

  <target name="default">
    <!-- regexpmapper breaks when regexp contains a property-path with backslashes (on Windows) -->
    <pathconvert dirsep="/" property="basedir-fwd-slash">
      <path location="${basedir}" />
    </pathconvert>

    <!--
      build-fileset filter step
      No Ant resource collection supports space-separated list of absolute paths
      which are also quoted to support spaces in paths.
      So we cheat by using a filelist which prepends each path with dummy basedir
      and leaves the path itself in quotes.
      We then use regexpmapper to strip the dummy basedir and also filter 
      build-fileset to leave only grammar-files in basedir.
     -->
    <pathconvert pathsep=" " property="build-fileset-filtered">
      <filelist dir="${basedir}" files="${build-fileset}" />
      <regexpmapper from="^${basedir-fwd-slash}/(&quot;${basedir-fwd-slash}/.*\.g4&quot;)$$" to="\1" handledirsep="true" />
    </pathconvert>

    <!--
      In case no build-fileset is provided prepare a list of all grammars
      using the same format.
      Note that all-grammars property lacks outer quotes, they must be added
      when using the property.
     -->
    <pathconvert pathsep="&quot; &quot;" property="all-grammars">
